Persecution

May 1 is a major Communist holiday, “International Workers’ Day”, and in 1965 the Communists held a parade and rally in a major square, which also happened to be Holy Saturday, the day before Pascha. Father Gabriel was returning from serving the Divine Liturgy and saw a 26-foot picture of Lenin decorating a side of a building with the caption “Glory to Great Lenin!” Unnoticed by the guards, Father Gabriel went up to the portrait and set it on fire. As the flames devoured the portrait he cried to the crowd: “Why are you bowing down before idols? Glory is due not to this corpse but to Jesus Christ Who trampled down death and gave us eternal life!”

The mob descended on him, beating and kicking him and would certainly have killed him if not for the intervention of the police. He was in a coma for a month with eighteen broken bones. The Communists sentenced him to be executed but the story of the incident became known to Western news media. Instead of killing him, Father Gabriel was sent to a psychiatric hospital where he was drugged, beaten and tortured. He was classified as a schizophrenic psychopath whose belief in God was part of his mental illness.

Interestingly, his official medical diagnosis chart from the Communist doctors has the official number “666”, which happen to be the number of the antichrist in the Book of Revelation.

He was released from the hospital under one condition: that the Patriarch of Georgia suspend him from his priestly ministry. St. Gabriel became a pariah; even his former friends and fellow priests avoided him. He continued attending church services, humbly receiving Communion while standing in line with the lay people. Finally, in 1971 the Patriarch of Georgia lifted his suspension, restored his priestly ministry and appointed him the priest of the convent of Samtavro. Here he lived simply, fasting severely and praying, living for a time in a wooden hut which was an abandoned chicken coop.
