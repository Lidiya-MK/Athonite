# Athonite
I have always loved reading, and about a year ago, I stumbled upon a genre of books that profoundly transformed my life. This project is my way of honoring the authors whose work has left such a lasting impact on me. Although it's still a work in progress, Iâ€™ve included a portion of the app's prototype to offer a glimpse.
