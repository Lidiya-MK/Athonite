Some Teachings of St. Gabriel
Your conscience is a small God. Before going to bed, render a short account to yourself: how you spent the day, what you did, when you sinned, what should have been done. Be demanding towards yourself.

In the end Days a man will be saved by love, humbleness and kindness. Kindness will open the gates of Heaven; humbleness will lead into the Heaven; a man, whose heart is filled with love, will see the God.

Every sin is enmity with God! Aren’t you afraid to be enemies with Him? Once you have committed a sin, do not carry it on your back for a long time; it hangs over your life like a death-dealing sword. Go speedily to a priest and repent. There the Lord Himself, Who forgives sins and is merciful, will forgive you your sins through the mediation of His servant. Woe to him who does not understand the mystery of Confession. After all, it is God’s saving mercy sent down to man by God.
